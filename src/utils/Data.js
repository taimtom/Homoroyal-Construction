    title: "E&C firms strive to balance sustainability and efficiency",
    reads: [
      "Sustainability continues to be a business imperative for the construction industry. E&C companies face a multidimensional challenge on this front as they adapt to evolving market trends and environmental regulations and meet customer demands for greener buildings, while also preventing construction costs from accelerating too rapidly.",
      "According to the International Energy Agency, buildings account for 30% of global energy consumption and 26% of global energy-related emissions.5 With the growing adoption of efficient building materials and sustainable construction practices, the industry is expected to be better positioned to accelerate changes and align with the International Energy Agency’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, which requires all new buildings and 20% of existing structures to be zero-carbon-ready by 2030.6 According to the US Green Building Council’s 2023 report, sustainability is a top priority for most surveyed E&C firms, as it aligns with their organizational mission and business strategies.7 Strategies such as reducing the embodied carbon of key construction materials, passive design principles, and the use of energy-efficient equipment can accelerate decarbonization by minimizing the overall carbon dioxide emissions associated with both the construction and operation of a building.8",
      "The US government is also prioritizing sustainable construction through the Federal Buy Clean Initiative. For instance, the initiative has led to the specification of more than US$2 billion for the procurement of lower-carbon construction materials like asphalt, concrete, and steel for federal procurement and their use in federally funded projects. It also resulted in the allocation of US$100 million to support state, local government, and public utility purchases of building products derived from converted carbon emissions.",
      "The IRA incentivizes businesses for energy-efficient improvements such as insulation, lighting, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems through funding of more than US$1.7 billion on top of additional tax credits.10 Efficiency—that is, delivering structures that minimize resource usage while optimizing operational performance—is likely to become key to sustainable construction. The upfront costs associated with sustainable construction can be offset by reduced long-term life cycle costs. Such reductions in costs may be derived from the usage of high-performance facades and energy-efficient systems.11",
      "In addition to balancing sustainability with efficiency, the increasing occurrences of severe weather events such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires have raised the focus on resilient design. As highlighted by the US Green Building Council, building owners and customers are showing greater interest in green building approaches that address a range of resilience demands.13 With such new demands on both sustainability and resilience, the industry is poised to take advantage of an increase in the development of advanced and emerging materials such as self-healing or high-performance eco-friendly concrete, electrical steel, graphene, and carbon fiber composites. These new purpose-driven materials are engineered to surpass the capabilities of naturally occurring materials and offer benefits such as durability, flexibility, circularity, stability, and efficacy.14 Sustainable materials such as treated wood, low-carbon bricks, and silica fumes15 may also see an uptick as E&C firms work to reduce the carbon footprint of new buildings. Furthermore, firms can experiment with an array of passive design techniques to bolster building efficiencies and reduce energy demand. These techniques may include orienting structures (buildings) to avoid or capture solar heat, designing green roofs to reduce heat absorption and provide insulation, incorporating energy-efficient fixtures and daylight-responsive lighting controls to reduce energy consumption, and designing building envelopes for effective insulation and moisture control to stabilize indoor temperatures.12 Delivering sustainable structures in a cost-effective manner is paramount for E&C firms in differentiating themselves in the market and satisfying customer priorities. E&C companies are likely to continue exploring innovative and technology-enabled strategies to balance sustainability and efficiency in 2024.",
      "Regardless of the method for achieving sustainability, E&C companies are expected to begin prioritizing sustainable design tactics and structural performance during the conceptual phase. Such early planning can result in substantial reductions in carbon emissions.16 E&C companies can also incorporate circular economy principles early within the design and construction process. Based on these principles, companies may engage in reusing materials, designing structures for disassembly, and reducing waste to address environmental concerns and support business growth.",
      "Utilizing technologies and techniques such as optioneering powered by generative design, simulations, and building information modeling (BIM) can allow companies to model a building’s performance and carbon footprint, and estimate both cost and schedule prior to construction, thereby enabling seamless project delivery. These technologies can also improve efficiency, increase delivery confidence, and hone resource allocation, ultimately lowering project expenses and risks. Furthermore, applications of BIM, IoT sensors, data analytics, and energy optimization techniques can contribute to reducing emissions.",

    title: "Designing the Road Structure",
    reads: [
      "The construction of road infrastructure is an essential component of the planning of modern cities and civil engineering, influencing daily traffic and its safety and commencement. An effective road design means that there is free-flowing traffic, few or no incidences of accidents, and the least possible time on the road. The first step is to define the need for the road, whether it is for cities, farms, or fast-moving traffic.",
      "Environmental issues, traffic intensity, and regulation of the project area all matter in these structures’ construction. They also have to select the right materials, whether flexible like asphalt or rigid like concrete, depending on the choice of the contractor or client.",
      "The horizontal and vertical alignments of the road are well-defined in such a manner that visibility and safety are considered. Further, drainage facilities are provided and are meant to allow free drainage of water so that water can never accumulate on the road surface since this is dangerous and causes accidents.  Such features as smart roads and sustainable materials are implemented as the pace of industry development focuses on the environment.",
      "Therefore, the vision is to see a good road structure network that can support today’s traffic needs and, at the same time, prepare for the future needs of the country. This includes careful conception, superior tools, and ongoing assurance to guarantee that they will still be functional and secure in the future.",
      "In conclusion, the road structure is a critical component of modern civil engineering. It is designed to support the needs of the city, the environment, and the future needs of the country. The road structure network should be carefully conceived, designed, and maintained to ensure that it will still be functional and secure in the future.",

    title: "Bad Supervisors in Construction Safety",
    reads: [
      "Construction sites are inherently dangerous places, and the role of a supervisor is critical in ensuring the safety and well-being of workers. Unfortunately, not all supervisors are up to the task, and the presence of bad supervisors can significantly increase the risk of accidents and injuries. In this article, we’ll explore the impact of bad supervisors on construction safety, the traits that define them, and the steps that can be taken to mitigate their negative effects.",
      "One of the most common reasons for bad supervisors in construction safety is poor communication. Supervisors often do not understand the importance of the project, the challenges, or the risks involved. They may not communicate their expectations, deadlines, or the reasons for their actions to their team members, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications. This can result in delays, missed deadlines, and unforeseen issues.",
      "The presence of bad supervisors in the construction industry is a significant concern, as their actions and attitudes can directly affect the safety and well-being of workers. These supervisors may not only lack the necessary leadership skills but also fail to enforce critical safety protocols. This negligence can create a dangerous work environment where safety measures are overlooked or ignored, increasing the likelihood of accidents and injuries.",
      "Moreover, bad supervisors may prioritize project deadlines over safety, pressuring workers to cut corners or rush through tasks. This emphasis on speed over safety can lead to hazardous shortcuts and compromised work practices, further endangering the lives of construction workers.",
      "The negative impact of bad supervisors extends beyond physical safety risks. Their poor leadership can erode trust and communication within the team, creating a climate of fear or intimidation. Workers may feel reluctant to report safety hazards or voice concerns, fearing retaliation or dismissal. This breakdown in communication can prevent the identification and resolution of safety issues, allowing dangerous conditions to persist unchecked.",
      "In addition, bad supervisors can contribute to a culture of negligence, where safety is not viewed as a priority. This attitude can permeate throughout the team, leading to a widespread disregard for safety protocols and an increase in preventable accidents.",
      "To mitigate the negative effects of bad supervisors, it is essential to develop and implement a strong, effective, and inclusive leadership culture. This can include fostering open communication, promoting a culture of respect, empathy, and fairness, and providing opportunities for workers to voice their concerns and report safety hazards. Additionally, it is crucial to invest in training and development to ensure that supervisors understand the importance of safety and the risks associated",
